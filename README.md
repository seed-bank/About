# About

So... this project is intended to be a wrapper for the creation of 'seeds' leveraging the Yeoman generator. Its intent is to generate new seeds based on convention rather than configuration. For example, adding a new file to the system should be easy and simple without having to resort to managing low level javascript to accomplish such as simple task.

Note that this is still early days in this projects development so usefull features such as updating files and injecting content will be completed at a future stage. For now, you will be able to organize files for templating in order to get started quickly.

# Why

In short, I got sick of writting Yeoman generators everytime I wanted to start a new microservice project. Each time I had to copy/paste code and cluge around with it until I could get it to work. Its a great tool... but its tedious and, quit frankly, a little boring.

# Goals

Create a framework ontop of Yeoman for community members to create seeds and contrubute back.

# Two Components

1. Tiller... explaine.
2. GenesisaWe will be contributing generators where we can give back. IN some cases this will be generic tools and in others they may be constructed for developers within the shopin, relateid....

Additionally,you can create your own generators and host it in your own repositories.
